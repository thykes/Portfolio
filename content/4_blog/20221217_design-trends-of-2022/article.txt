Text:

In 2022 we saw a lot of designs, some good and some bad but there are a few things that stick out as we think of the year as a whole. 

Natural and organic elements: As people continue to prioritize sustainability and eco-friendliness, we may see more designers incorporating natural and organic elements into their work. This could include using materials like wood, stone, and plants, as well as incorporating biophilic design principles that bring the outdoors inside.

Soft, muted colors: Bold, vibrant colors have been popular in recent years, but 2022 could see a shift towards softer, more muted tones. Think pastel shades, pale neutrals, and dusty hues. These colors can create a calm, peaceful atmosphere and may be especially appealing as people continue to spend more time at home.

Sustainable design: Sustainability will continue to be a major trend in design as people become more aware of the environmental impact of their choices. This could include using recycled or sustainable materials, designing for energy efficiency, and incorporating features that encourage reuse and reduce waste.

Multifunctional spaces: As people continue to spend more time at home, there may be a greater focus on designing spaces that serve multiple purposes. This could include creating multifunctional furniture, using modular design elements, and finding ways to maximize the use of limited space.

Personalization and customization: With the rise of e-commerce and online shopping, people are becoming more accustomed to being able to personalize and customize the products they buy. This trend may extend to interior design, with people seeking out unique, one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect their personal style and taste.
